# **Face Detection and Privacy Protection**
- This is a simple Project on Face detection from an Image and Blurring the face part of an Image for the purpose of privacy protection. I have included this Project because it was so interesting for me at first. It is one of the first Image Prediction Projects I have ever done. You can get insights about the Implementation of Gaussian Filters as well as Cascade Classfier in this Project.
